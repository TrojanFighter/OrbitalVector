# OrbitalVector

An arcade-y flight sim that really takes place in space! Around earth! With missiles and lasers and BBQ galore! 

# Milestones
  - Min features for arcade/flight sim
    - lock on animation
    - weapon inventory
      - weapon switch/select animation/sound/control
    - rate of fire; recharge rate, range/missile life, deltaV
    - target select within targeting fov
    
  - Min features for space maneuvering
    - velocity vector wrt current sphere of influence - prograde/retro grade, inner/outer, north/south
    - velocity vector wrt target - prograde/retro
    - deltaV left
    - acceleration factor indicator
  - Min eye candy
    - engine lit/fire on acceleration
    - engine wiggle on maneuvering
    - RCS particles
    - explosion
  - Orbital mechanics
    - plot intercept trajectories with burn vector/dV req; real time update
